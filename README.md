 ## Hello! 👋

🧍

## Glad to have you here!

I’m a Cloud DevOps Engineer and Software Engineer with Java and Springboot stack. Being a DevOps and backend developer allows me to not only develop cutting-edge backend applications but also to deploy them and manage the servers in the cloud and on-site. 
I love designing light yet powerful systems, distributed yet synchronized and beautiful yet effective. I also frequently blog about the world behind the screen which involves system designs, databases, security, servers, optimization, deployments, and management. I want to learn promising technology concepts like ML, AI, Blockchain technologies, etc.
