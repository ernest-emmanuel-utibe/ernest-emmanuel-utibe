 # Hello! 👋

## Glad to have you here! 🧍

I’m a Cloud DevOps Engineer and Software Engineer with Java experience. Being a DevOps and backend engineer allows me to not only develop cutting-edge backend applications but also to deploy them and manage the servers in the cloud and on-site. 

I love designing light yet powerful systems, distributed yet synchronized and beautiful yet effective.

I also frequently blog about the world behind the screen which involves system designs, databases, security, servers, optimization, deployments, and management. I want to learn promising technology concepts like ML, AI, Blockchain technologies, etc.
