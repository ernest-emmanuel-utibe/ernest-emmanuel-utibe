 # Hello! 👋

## Glad to have you here! 🧍

I'm a Cloud Engineer and Software Engineer passionate about designing, deploying, and managing applications both in the cloud.

In my role as a Cloud Engineer, I specialize in creating efficient, powerful, and distributed systems that are synchronized and visually appealing. I handle everything from system design to database management, security, server optimization, and deployment.

I regularly share my insights and experiences on my blog, covering topics such as system design, databases, security, servers, optimization, deployments, and management. My goal is to stay at the forefront of technology by continuously learning about promising concepts like machine learning, artificial intelligence, and blockchain technologies.
